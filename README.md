# LearningGitHub
This Reporsitory is just to refresh my GitHub, so I can use it later for all the new research I wanna Engage in which I want to Share with other people out there. You can only become better when you share your research and others comment on them. This build new future approaches and help create better technological advancements. It took me sometime to realse that without having a portfolio, it will be difficult for organisations out there to see and review your progress in which area you are interested in getting a job in.
